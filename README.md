# Implementing CNN Using MNIST Dataset

This repository provides an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow for image classification tasks with the MNIST dataset.

## Overview

The project covers the following key aspects:

### 1. Import Necessary Libraries

The TensorFlow library and its Keras API are utilized for building and training the CNN model. The mnist dataset module is specifically imported to access the MNIST dataset for digit classification.

### 2. Load and Preprocess the Dataset

The MNIST dataset, consisting of handwritten digits, is loaded and preprocessed. Images are normalized to a range between 0 and 1 to facilitate model training. Labels are encoded using one-hot encoding, converting numerical labels into a format suitable for classification tasks.

### 3. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architecture

The CNN architecture is structured to effectively learn features from the input images. It includes:
- Convolutional layers: These layers extract features from the input images through convolution operations.
- Max pooling layers: Used to downsample feature maps, focusing on the most relevant information.
- Fully connected layers: These layers process the flattened feature maps to make final predictions.

### 4. Compile and Train the Model

The model is compiled with appropriate settings including the optimizer (Adam), loss function (categorical cross-entropy), and metrics (accuracy). It is then trained using the training dataset with a specified number of epochs and batch size. During training, a validation split ensures monitoring of model performance on unseen data.

### 5. Evaluate the Model

After training, the model's performance is evaluated using the test dataset to measure its accuracy in classifying unseen images of digits.

### 6. Make Predictions and Visualize Results

Once trained, the model is used to predict digit classes for new images from the test set. Predictions are then compared with actual labels to assess model accuracy. Visualization techniques may optionally be applied to illustrate model predictions alongside actual images.

### One-Hot Encoding

One-hot encoding is employed to transform categorical labels (digits 0-9) into a binary format, enabling the model to predict the correct digit class with higher accuracy.

## Usage

To utilize this implementation, ensure TensorFlow is installed (`pip install tensorflow`).
